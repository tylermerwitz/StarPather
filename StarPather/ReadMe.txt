First, click the "Select .chart" button near the top of
 the window and find the .chart file you wish to use
Next, select one of the four options for pathing:
     -No Squeeze: Find the optimal star power path for the
      chart entered if you do NOT squeeze any notes.
     -Ultra Easy: Returns the score you will get on this
      chart if you always activate star power as soon as
      it is available and do not use the whammy.
     -Easy: Returns the score you will get on this chart
      if you always activate star power as soon as it's
      available
     -Easy Full: Returns the score you will get on this chart
      if you always activate star power as soon your star
      power meter is completely full

Finally, hit the "Optimize" button, and viola!
The program will print the Star Power path requested!

Note: It is recommend you use this tool in combination
