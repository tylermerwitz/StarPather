This program was designed to optimize the Star Power path
for any .chart file. Please report any bugs to this
program's github page:
https://github.com/tylermerwitz/StarPather

Special thanks to Nemo296 for his invaluable knowledge of the
.chart file format and for his help in resolving many of
the initial issues I ran into with the program's scoring
logic!

Useage:
First, click the "Select .chart" button near the top of
 the window and find the .chart file you wish to use
Next, select one of the four options for pathing:
     -Full Squeeze: Find the optimal star power path for the
      chart entered with squeezing and early whammying.
     -Early Whammy: Find the optimal star power path for the
      chart entered with NO squeezing and early whammying
      whammying.
     -Easy: Find the optimal star power path for the chart
      entered with NO squeezing and NO early whammying
     -Ultra Easy: Returns the score you will get on this
      chart if you always activate star power as soon as
      it's available
Finally, hit the "Optimize" button, and viola!
The program will print the Star Power path requested!

Note: It is recommend you use this tool in combination
with Gutair_Hero_Tools.exe in order to get a better
understanding and visualization of where to activate
Star Power
