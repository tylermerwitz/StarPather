This program was designed to optimize the Star Power path
for any .chart file. Please report any bugs to this
program's github page:

Special thanks to Nemo296 for their invaluable knowledge of the
.chart file format and for his help in resolving many of
the initial issues I ran into with the program's scoring
logic!

Special thanks to CyclopsDragon for their rigorous testing
of StarPather and for their amazing bug-finding skills!

Useage:
First, click the "Select .chart" button near the top of
 the window and find the .chart file you wish to use
Next, select one of the four options for pathing:
     -Full Squeeze: Find the optimal star power path for the
      chart entered with squeezing and early whammying.
     -Early Whammy: Find the optimal star power path for the
      chart entered with NO squeezing and early whammying
      whammying.
     -Easy: Find the optimal star power path for the chart
      entered with NO squeezing and NO early whammying
     -Lazy Whammy: Find the optimal star power path for the
      chart if you get 80% of the maximum possible whammy
      Star Power
Finally, hit the "Optimize" button, and viola!
The program will print the Star Power path requested!

Note: It is recommend you use this tool in combination
with Gutair_Hero_Tools.exe in order to get a better
understanding and visualization of where to activate
